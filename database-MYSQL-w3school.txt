1.
What is SQL?
SQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases.
SQL is used to insert, search, update, and delete database records.
2.SELECT * FROM Customers;
3.SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
4.
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
In this tutorial, we will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands

    SELECT - extracts data from a database
    UPDATE - updates data in a database
    DELETE - deletes data from a database
    INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
    CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
    ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
    CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
    ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
    DROP TABLE - deletes a table
    CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
    DROP INDEX - deletes an index

6.The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

7.SELECT CustomerName, City, Country FROM Customers;

8.SELECT CustomerID,City,Country FROM Customers;

9.
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

10.SELECT Country FROM Customers;

11.SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

12.The following SQL statement counts and returns the number of different (distinct) countries in the "Customers" table:

13.SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

14.
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

15.
Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!

16.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';

17.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;

18.
Operators in The WHERE Clause

> 		Greater than 	
< 		Less than 	
>= 		Greater than or equal 	
<= 		Less than or equal 	
<> 		Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
